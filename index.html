            <p>Loves chasings tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often found sitting by the fire in
                wintertime, and in sun patches when available. He’s energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves
                people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long.</p>
            <p>Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He
                especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn’t get a snack.</p>

            <img src="images/classic_juno.JPG" width="400" alt="Black and brown dog asleep on his side">
            <div class="pet-intro-div" tabindex="0">
            <p>No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the more special. He was adopted before
                he was one year old; despite this and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the same size,
                hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered age of ten years old, Juno is dealing with hip
                problems, but manages to stay in good spirits.</p>
            <p>One of Juno’s favorite pastimes is finding the dirtiest puddle within a one-mile radius and making sure
                every inch of him makes contact with said puddle. If rolling around in dirt was an Olympic sport, Juno
                would have been the one that facilitated its inclusion into the Olympics.</p>

            <div class="pet-intro-div" tabindex="0">
            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>
