            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and

                about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists. Every year visitors
